# PeriodicTable
*Element-ary, my dear Watson!*

Another of my projects for practising: a **JavaFX-based periodic table**.

The aim is to create a fun way for students to learn the 118 wonderful elements that make up the world we live in.

At the moment, the app contains several buttons (in Spanish, sorry) that start distinct modes of playing:
- *Colocar*: Select the place where the element should go, no hints (except for the cell's color).
- *Cancelar*: Cancels the current game and reverts the table back to its original form.
- *Nombre*: Shows the name of the element in question, which has to be placed using the symbols still visible on the table.
- *SÃ­mbolo*: Exactly the opposite of the Nombre button, shows the symbol of the element, which has to be placed according to its name.

**What's next**:
- Obviously, the appearance and disposition of the buttons have to be improved.
- More playing modes.
- More options (e.g. more/less hints, show/hide the rare earths, etc.).
